short-description: A variety of Amazon Alexa skills

---

Amazon Alexa is a personal assistant product from Amazon that listens to your voice commands and carries out a number of other functions. The great thing about Alexa is its ability to learn new "skills". These skills are free for any developer to pickup and create to have Alexa respond to your voice, make appointments, play games, and more.

Currently, I'm in the process of developing a number of new skills for Alexa to help hone and develop my own programming skills.

The skills I'm working on will include:

-Trivia
-Facts/General Knowledge
-Specialities

More updates on the progress of these to come!
