short-description: A comprehensive fantasy sports draft client

---

As my capstone project through Bloc, I've decided to build to perfection my ultimate goal: a comprehensive fantasy sports draft client.

This client will allow up to 16 users to join a single room and draft their favorite players for their upcoming fantasy sports season.

It will allow users to chat, see stats, images, and best available players.


This is something I've wanted to do for a long time now. Knowing the industry as deeply as I do, I feel there's a multitude of improvements that can be made, and that's what I strive to get to completing in the near future.

Please check back later for some progress on the application!!
