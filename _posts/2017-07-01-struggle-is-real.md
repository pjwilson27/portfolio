title: The Struggle is Real
---

For beginners in computer programming and web development, learning a language can at times be quite challenging. 

The industry is always evolving, what you may learn today may not be good in an a few years, different companies you could work for may want you to do what you're doing through a different framework, the possible pitfalls are endless.

Personally when it comes to coding, my issues always stem from my constant rush and overlooking little details here and there. When I get down to it and get in a groove, it's sometimes easy for me to carry on and even forget some fundamentals like going back and making sure a piece of the app works before moving onto a new piece. Like the saying goes, the devil is in the details, and skipping over those details for a minute can prove to leave you in a few hours of hell trying to go back later and figuring out what to do to get this piece moving.

Good news! This is an easily fixable thing once we learn to chill and slow down. It's one thing to be stuck against the deadline, but if you really want to make that deadline, eliminating any possibility for rework is the only way. From simple things like reading back your own code line by line to make sure everything makes sense, the little bits of extra seconds here and there can save a whole bunch of minutes or hours way later down the road.


Breathe. Stretch. Relax.
