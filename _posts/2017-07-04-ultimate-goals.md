title: Ultimate Goals as a Web Developer
---

Ever since I began coding about three years ago, my motivations have always stayed the same. Create content that inspires and captivates the viewer, create something with purpose, and have fun doing it. 

I've always been a fairly imaginative person, but unfortunately, my artistic skills are generally slacking. Coding, however, has been a revitalization of sorts, where I can fully imagine my end-game and create it.

I love the idea of being able to create things that can one day make a persons life easier. Things that may not reshape the world as we know it, but can put a smile on a persons face and can take them away from whatever is troubling them. 

While finding the right direction for a specific project like that can take time, acquiring and developing the skills in order to make that project when all is said and done is a continual undertaking. I love learning about new languages and how it can make tasks that seem mundane or repetitive, easy and quick.

Ultimately, I'd love to learn as many languages and skills as possible. To create something fun and captivating for my audience, whether as part of a team or on my own. Day in and day out using the abundance of resources the internet and books of all kinds are available to me in order to keep making myself better.

It is a goal I can see as being achievable with much practice and dedication put to it. It is a goal I plan to keep working towards until I can successfully see myself on a team with like-minded people, helping to make the world a better place.


One app at a time.
