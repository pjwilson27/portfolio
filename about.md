Hi! My name is Phil Wilson, and I'm a freelance web developer. I've been coding now for about three years off and on, but have recently dedicated myself to continue my education in the matter when I joined Bloc in the fall of 2016.

Currently, I'm finishing up my coursework with Bloc, and should be graduating from the program by August 2017.

I'm proficient with HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery, Angular, Ruby, and Rails.

As I'm always trying to learn more, I'm refocusing my efforts and trying to pick up more with React, C#, .NET, Python, and more to really become a well-rounded developer.


When I'm not programming away, I enjoy spending time with my wife, Amanda and our three dogs Titan, Sadie, and Ruby (can you guess which language is my favorite?). We currently live in Columbus, Ohio and in our free time we enjoy sporting events, outdoors and nature, and just generally spending time with our friends.


If you have any other specific questions for me, I'd love to answer them. Please don't hesitate to contact me!
